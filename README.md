## JAVA TRAINING UPSKILLING PROJECTS - FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL
This repo contains all projects undertaken during my upskilling journey in Java.

It holds foundational level concepts learnt as I journey through mastery of the Java programming language.

### Layout of Concepts
Each folder holds a project created using [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to demonstrate understanding in concepts outlined as foundational by [Amalitech](https://amalitech.org/).
